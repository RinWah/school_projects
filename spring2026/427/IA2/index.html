        <h2>First-generation student & part-time barista</h2>
        <p class="bio">Maria is a first generation student and part-time barista. She is balancing school alongside
            her part-time job as a barista while managing her own bills and her family's bills. She's frustrated
            with inaccurate bank statements and unexpected fees, but she is determined to build strong goals through
            weekly progress.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build an emergency fund with $1,000 in it.</li>
                    <li>Save $600 for her spring semesteer textbooks.</li>
                    <li>Save $1,200 within the next year for her first month's rent when she moves out from her family's 
                        home.

                <ul>
                    <li>Hidden fees: "I hate hidden fees like shipping or processing."</li>
                    <li>Inaccurate bank statements: "My card gets declined even though I have money. Pending vs. available is 
                        the worst."
                    </li>
                    <li>Difficulty reading bank statements: "When the merchant name is unrecognizable or there's a surprise
                        hold, I shouldn't have to call customer service."
